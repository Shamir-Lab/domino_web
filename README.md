# DOMINO webinized - Finding active modules has never been easier!

DOMINO as a web-based service is avaliable [here](http://rack-shamir3.cs.tau.ac.il:8000/)

The original standalone version of DOMINO is available [here](https://github.com/Shamir-Lab/DOMINO)

## Instructions: 

### To find active modules you need:
* Active gene file: tab-delimited A line-separated list of genes. 
* Network file: A tab-delimited sif formatted file. The file should have only two genes per row, where the first row is the header of the file.

In both files the gene identifiers are Ensembl ids. 

Njoy! :)
